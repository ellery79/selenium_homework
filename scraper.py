Library Book Scraper

This module provides functionality to scrape book details from a library website
using Selenium WebDriver. It extracts information such as title, author, 
publication year, and other metadata from book listings across paginated pages.

The main components of this module are:
- WebDriver setup for headless Chrome browser
- Functions to extract text and book details from HTML elements
- CSV writing capability for storing scraped data
- Pagination handling to scrape books across multiple pages

Dependencies:
- selenium: For web scraping and browser automation
- csv: For writing scraped data to CSV files

Usage:
Run this script directly to start the scraping process. The results will be
saved in a CSV file named 'scraped_books.csv' in the same directory.

Note: Ensure that the Chrome WebDriver executable (chromedriver) is available
in the './chromedriver/' directory relative to this script.

This version (1.1) includes optimizations for memory efficiency, processing
books one at a time instead of storing all book details in memory at once.
